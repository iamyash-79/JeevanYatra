These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between you and JeevanYatra and govern your access to, and use of, the Platform and all services we provide, including discovery of travel packages, custom itineraries, reservations, payments, and customer support (collectively, the “Services”). By browsing the Platform, creating an account, initiating a booking, or otherwise using any Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, together with any policies referenced herein, such as our Privacy Policy and Refund & Cancellation Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use the Platform or Services.</p>
          <p>We may update these Terms to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. The “Last Updated” date will be shown at the top of this page. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. These Terms apply in addition to any itinerary-specific conditions disclosed at the time of booking. In the event of a conflict, the itinerary-specific conditions will prevail for that booking. Nothing in these Terms affects your non-excludable statutory rights under applicable law.</p>

Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. References to “including” or “includes” mean “including without limitation”.</p>

If you are acting on behalf of a minor or another traveller (for example, a family member or group), you represent and warrant that you have full authority to provide their information, accept these Terms on their behalf, and ensure their compliance. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information at all times, including names exactly as they appear on government identification, and to promptly update any details that change. We may, at our sole discretion, refuse or cancel access to the Platform or Services, suspend accounts, or decline Bookings if eligibility, identity, payment method, or compliance concerns arise.</p>
          <p>Use of the Platform is subject to all applicable laws and regulations. You agree not to use the Services for any unlawful purpose, to attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, or to disrupt or degrade the performance of the Platform. We reserve the right to carry out verification checks, including identity, contact, or payment validations, and to require supporting documents prior to confirming or continuing a Booking. Where legal consent of parents or guardians is required for minors, you are responsible for obtaining and retaining such consents and for ensuring that all travellers meet visa, health, and entry requirements relevant to the itinerary.</p>

          <p>Bookings may be initiated online through the Platform, via our customer support channels, or through authorized partners. A Booking is considered confirmed only upon receipt of the stated deposit or full payment (as applicable) and issuance of a written confirmation from JeevanYatra. You are responsible for reviewing all confirmation details immediately and notifying us of any discrepancies within twenty‑four (24) hours. Payment methods accepted may include credit/debit cards, UPI, net banking, or bank transfer; availability can vary by itinerary and jurisdiction. You authorize us to charge your selected payment method for the amounts due, including service fees, taxes, surcharges, and any post‑booking amendments you request.</p>
          <p>Deposits are typically non‑refundable unless stated otherwise. Where staged payments are offered, you must pay instalments by the specified due dates. Failure to make timely payments may result in automatic cancellation, forfeiture of deposits, and application of cancellation fees under our Refund & Cancellation Policy. Currency conversions, card issuer fees, and bank charges are your responsibility. Promotional codes or discounts are valid only for the stated period and conditions and cannot be combined unless explicitly allowed. We may cancel a Booking for suspected fraud, chargeback risk, or breach of these Terms and will endeavour to notify you using your registered contact details.</p>

          <p>Unless expressly stated, prices are quoted per person in Indian Rupees (INR) and are based on double‑occupancy or standard room configuration. The price for a specific itinerary will specify what is included (for example, accommodation category, meals, transfers, tours, entrance fees, guide services) and what is excluded (for example, personal expenses, optional activities, visa charges, travel insurance, tips, or city taxes). Prices are subject to availability at the time of booking and may vary due to supplier adjustments, currency fluctuations, tax changes, fuel surcharges, or other cost factors outside our control. We strive for accuracy but reserve the right to correct genuine errors or omissions; if a material pricing error is identified after your payment, you may choose to pay the corrected price or cancel for a full refund of amounts paid to us for that component.</p>
          <p>Child, infant, senior, or student rates—where available—are applied strictly according to supplier rules and proof of eligibility may be required at check‑in or boarding. Room upgrade requests, specific bedding, adjoining rooms, or special meal preferences are strictly subject to availability and may incur surcharges. If a component included in your itinerary becomes unavailable after confirmation, we will offer, where feasible, an equivalent or higher‑value alternative at no additional cost; otherwise, a proportionate refund will be processed for the affected component only. Package breakdown for individual component refunds is not permitted unless mandated by law or specified in writing.</p>

          <p>Your right to cancel and receive a refund is governed by our Refund & Cancellation Policy referenced at checkout and incorporated by reference into these Terms. In general, cancellations requested sufficiently in advance may receive partial or full refunds, whereas cancellations close to the travel date may be non‑refundable due to supplier rules. Certain components (including but not limited to flights issued on special fares, event tickets, permits, or promotional rates) may be strictly non‑cancellable and non‑refundable once booked. All cancellation requests must be made in writing from your registered email. The effective date of cancellation is when we receive your written request during Business Days; requests made outside Business Days will be deemed received on the next Business Day.</p>
          <p>Refunds, where applicable, will be processed to the original payment method within the timelines indicated in our policy, subject to delays outside our control (for example, banking networks or supplier processing). Administrative fees, service charges, and any unrecoverable supplier costs will be deducted. No‑show or partially used services generally do not qualify for refunds. Where travel is disrupted by Force Majeure, we will endeavour to facilitate date changes, credits, or supplier‑offered solutions as a first resort. We recommend comprehensive travel insurance that covers cancellation for covered reasons, medical events, and travel interruptions to mitigate financial exposure.</p>

          <p>Post‑booking modifications such as name corrections, travel date shifts, room category changes, or activity substitutions may be possible but are always subject to supplier approval, availability, and payment of any fare difference, reissue costs, and administrative amendment fees disclosed at the time of the request. Some suppliers treat any change as a cancellation and re‑booking, in which case the relevant cancellation policy will apply. Requests must be submitted in writing by the lead traveller or the payer on the Booking, and we may require verification to protect against unauthorized changes. We will present available options and costs for your approval before proceeding.</p>
          <p>We strongly recommend double‑checking all details at the time of confirmation to minimize the need for changes. Certain changes—such as downgrades or removal of included components—may not produce a refund if governed by a bundled or promotional rate. If you miss a scheduled service (for example, a transfer or tour departure), suppliers may treat it as a no‑show, and re‑accommodation is not guaranteed; any additional costs for catching up with the itinerary are your responsibility. Travel insurance that includes change fees or trip interruption coverage can help reduce unexpected expenses arising from necessary alterations.</p>

          <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that all travellers hold valid identification and travel documents required for the itinerary, including passports with sufficient validity, visas, permits, and vaccination or health certificates where applicable. Entry, transit, and health requirements can change without notice and may vary by nationality, transit points, and local regulations. We may provide general guidance as a courtesy, but such information is not a substitute for confirmation with official consular sources or healthcare providers. Failure to present the required documents or to meet carrier and destination rules may result in denied boarding, refusal of entry, fines, or deportation—costs for which you are entirely responsible.</p>
          <p>Names on all documents must exactly match the identification presented at check‑in. Some destinations require proof of onward travel, sufficient funds, or specific travel insurance coverage. Minors travelling without both parents may need consent letters or additional documentation. You should review timing for visa processing well in advance and maintain copies of essential documents separately from originals. For high‑altitude, adventure, or remote itineraries, we recommend consulting your physician and arranging insurance that covers emergency medical evacuation and adventure activities. No refund will be provided for services missed due to document or health non‑compliance.</p>

You agree not to engage in abusive, disruptive, illegal, or hazardous conduct that could endanger yourself, other travellers, or service personnel. You must arrive on time for departures and meeting points; the itinerary cannot always be adjusted for late arrivals, and missed services may be treated as no‑shows. You are responsible for safeguarding your belongings and travel documents; we are not liable for loss, theft, or damage except where required by law. Any damage you cause to accommodation, vehicles, or venues must be settled directly with the provider or will be charged to you.</p>
          <p>Health disclosures may be necessary for activities with physical demands or safety requirements. If your condition changes, you must inform us promptly so we can advise whether the itinerary remains suitable. Possession or use of prohibited items, harassment, or violation of property rules may result in removal from the tour without refund. Alcohol consumption should be moderate, and illegal drugs are strictly forbidden. For group departures, consideration for fellow travellers is essential; trip leaders may establish reasonable rules to promote a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.</p>

Where a material change is required prior to departure, we will notify you as soon as practicable and offer available alternatives of equal or greater value where feasible.

Minor changes that do not materially affect the overall value of the itinerary will not entitle you to a refund.</p>

Trip leaders or guides may make on‑the‑spot decisions to safeguard the group’s well‑being; such decisions are binding.
